My program doesn't work completely. For example, if the string "0700 1234" was given to it, it would only evaluate 0700 and discard 1234. I was unable to figure out how to make it evaluate the other arguments without breaking anything. 

My code calls TKcreate which creates a token. From the main, getState is called which gets the current state of the character. It does this by calling the appropiate functions Ts_State0 is the string starts with "0" or Ts_Digit if it starts with "1". I received help for the trimwhitespace function which is called from TKcreate before it gets passed into the getState functions. 

Terms of efficiency, my code is really inefficient but this was done in order to get as much correctness in terms of the output as possible.
